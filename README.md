# Development Environment for Ouatio

Requires:
* key-based access to the private ouatio_vagrant git repository. (Which is just a copy of the DSpace 5.3 release that we configured and checked in to GitHub.)
* a CentOS 7 vagrant base box for VMWare. There's a good setup for making one [here](https://github.com/geerlingguy/packer-centos-7/)
