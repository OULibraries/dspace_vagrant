# Simplified Ouatio DSpace Workflow



New code should be created in feature branches derived from the master
branch and merged in to the master branch in logical units.

Code should be well tested and considered ready for release before
merging into master, after which integration testing should be done
against master.

Release branches named release-YYYY.MM.DD should be created when
deploying code to production to snapshot the code that was deployed
and to provide a basis for hotfixes.
